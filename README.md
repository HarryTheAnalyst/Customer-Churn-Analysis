 Customer Churn Analysis: Internet Service Provider Case Study
Welcome to the Customer Churn Analysis project repository! This project dives deep into understanding when and why customers leave an internet service provider and provides actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

 Background
An internet service provider in California, USA, sought to understand customer churn — the rate at which customers default or discontinue their service. Using a comprehensive dataset, this project aims to uncover patterns, identify root causes of churn, and propose strategies to enhance customer retention.

 Project Overview
This project focuses on:
Analyzing customer churn data to understand trends and identify at-risk customers.
Visualizing insights using Tableau Public for dynamic and interactive dashboards.
Supporting decision-making with data transformation and analysis conducted in Excel.
Summarizing results in a professional PowerPoint presentation to communicate findings effectively.

 Dataset Overview
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains detailed information about customers and their interactions with the company. It includes 16 interrelated tables:
Billing
Churn_Category
Churn_Category_Reason
Churn_Reason
Contract
Customer
Customer_Churn_Category
Customer_Feature
Customer_Status
Dependency
Internet_Service
Internet_Service_Feature
Location
Marital_Status
Phone_Service
Payment
Service_Plan
The data spans multiple cities across California and includes metrics such as billing methods, customer demographics, internet service types, and more.

Skills Demonstrated
Data Cleaning: Ensuring data integrity by addressing missing values and inconsistencies in Excel.
Data Transformation: Structuring data for analysis and visualization.
Data Visualization: Creating interactive dashboards in Tableau Public.
Critical Thinking: Interpreting patterns to derive actionable insights.
Communication: Presenting findings effectively using PowerPoint.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The analysis focuses on the following KPIs:
1.Churn Rate: Percentage of customers leaving within a specific period.
2.Average Tenure of Customers: Identifying loyal customers and predicting at-risk ones.
3.Satisfaction Score: Correlating customer satisfaction with churn rates.
4.Monthly Revenue Per User (ARPU): Highlighting revenue growth opportunities.
5.Effect of Billing Type on Churn: Optimizing billing processes to enhance customer experience.
6.Average Extra Data Charges: Identifying dissatisfaction due to unexpected charges.
7.Churn by Customer Segment: Pinpointing high-churn demographics for tailored strategies.

Steps Carried Out in the Project
1.Data Cleaning & Transformation: Cleaning and preparing the dataset in Excel.
2.Data Visualization: Designing interactive dashboards in Tableau Public.
3.Presentation: Summarizing insights and recommendations in PowerPoint.

Key Insights and Conclusions
1.Overall Churn Rate: 38.8% of customers churned over 5 years.
2.Revenue Loss: Churn results in a monthly revenue loss of $37.2K, with an ARPU of $97.77.
3.Tenure Matters: Longer-tenured customers churn less often.
4.Service Quality:
o48% of churned customers reported very poor service delivery.
o79% of churned customers used paperless billing.
5.High-Risk Segments:
oCustomers using electronic check as a payment method.
oCustomers with fiber optic internet (67.2% churn rate).
oNon-married customers and those in Los Angeles and San Diego.
6.Service-Specific Issues:
oCustomers using phone services churn more.
oHigh churn among customers engaged in heavy internet tasks (e.g., online backups).

 Recommendations
1.Enhance Service Quality: Address complaints about poor service delivery to reduce churn.
2.Tailor Retention Strategies:
oFocus on high-risk customer segments (fiber optic users, short-term contracts).
oOffer personalized retention plans to customers nearing the end of their contracts.
3.Optimize Billing: Encourage a shift from electronic check to more reliable payment methods.
4.Reassess Pricing: Develop competitive plans to address high churn due to competitors’ offerings.
5.Focus on Customer Education: Inform customers about service features and appropriate plans to minimize extra charges.
